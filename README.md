# System.CommandLine exercises

This repo hosts a couple exercises that are used as part of a user study around the usability of the
[System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api) library.

The intent is for these to be from-zero exercises - no prior knowledge of the library is expected or assumed. Each exercise is numbered and named, and should be attempted in order.

## Our Goals

We want to understand how users experience the library holistically - acquiring the library, learning about it in documentation, experimenting with it in-editor - these are all areas of interest.

As you attempt the exercises, we'll be looking for areas where the library, documentation, or general flow are unexpected or present unreasonable difficulty. It helps a lot if you verbalize what your thoughts are along the way, as we don't (yet!) have a way of collecting telemetry on your brain during the exercise.

Each of the exercises will provide some amount of code representing the domain logic of the problem. Your tasks will largely be focused on how you design command line applications to integrate into these domain functions. Of course you are free to write any other code you need to accomplish that goal, but there shouldn't be any 'gotchas' or huge gaps in functionality missing.

## Prerequisites

You should only need the following to attempt the exercises:

* a git client (in order to clone this repository)
* [the latest .NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

## Next Steps
